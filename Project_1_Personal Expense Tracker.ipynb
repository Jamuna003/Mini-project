    "Personal Expense Tracker\n",
    "Problem Statement: \n",
    "\n",
    "In todayâ€™s fast-paced world, individuals need to track and manage their expenses effectively. Your task is to build a personal expense tracker that allows users to log daily expenses, categorize them, and track spending against a monthly budget. The tracker should also be able to save and load expenses from a file for future reference. \n",
    "\n",
    "Objectives:\n",
    "1.    Design and implement a personal expense tracker that enables users to manage their expenses\n",
    "2.    Allow users to categorize expenses and set monthly budgets\n",
    "3.    Implement file-handling functionality to save and load expense data\n",
    "4.    Create an interactive, menu-driven interface for ease of use\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps to Perform:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Add an expense:\n",
    "â€¢  Create a function to prompt the user for expense details. Ensure you ask for:\n",
    "\n",
    "The date of the expense in the format YYYY-MM-DD\n",
    "The category of the expense, such as Food or Travel\n",
    "The amount spent\n",
    "A brief description of the expense\n",
    "â€¢  Store the expense in a list as a dictionary, where each dictionary includes the date, category, amount, and description as key-value pairs\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "{'date': '2024-09-18', 'category': 'Food', 'amount': 15.50, 'description': 'Lunch with friends'}\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "2.  View expenses:\n",
    "â€¢   Write a function to retrieve and display all stored expenses\n",
    "      Ensure the function loops through the list of expenses and displays the date, category, amount, and description for each entry\n",
    "â€¢   Validate the data before displaying it\n",
    "      If any required details (date, category, amount, or description) are missing, skip the entry or notify the user that itâ€™s incomplete\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Set and track the budget:\n",
    "â€¢   Create a function that allows the user to input a monthly budget. Prompt the user to:\n",
    "     Enter the total amount they want to budget for the month\n",
    "â€¢   Create another function that calculates the total expenses recorded so far\n",
    "     Compare the total with the userâ€™s monthly budget\n",
    "     If the total expenses exceed the budget, display a warning (Example: You have exceeded your budget!)\n",
    "     If the expenses are within the budget, display the remaining balance (Example: You have 150 left for the month)\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Save and load expenses:\n",
    "â€¢   Implement a function to save all expenses to a CSV file, with each row containing the date, category, amount, and description of each expense\n",
    "â€¢   Create another function to load expenses from the CSV file. When the program starts, it should:\n",
    "     Read the saved data from the file\n",
    "     Load it back into the list of expenses so the user can see their previous expenses and continue from where they left off\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "5.  Create an interactive menu:\n",
    "\n",
    "Build a function to display a menu with the following options:\n",
    "Add expense\n",
    "View expenses\n",
    "Track budget\n",
    "Save expenses\n",
    "Exit\n",
    "Allow the user to enter a number to choose an option\n",
    "â€¢   Implement the following conditions:\n",
    "     If the user selects option 1, call the function to add an expense\n",
    "     If the user selects option 2, call the function to view expenses\n",
    "     If the user selects option 3, call the function to track the budget\n",
    "     If the user selects option 4, call the function to save expenses to the file\n",
    "     If the user selects option 5, save the expenses and exit the program\n",
    " "
